# PricingProjects

This repository contains two pricing projects that were self-initiated on topics that I'm passinate about. They both came with challenges, but I greatly enjoyed solving complex problems to get to these answers... And using math to do it!

1) Price Elasticity


2) Odd Ratios of Price Expectations
