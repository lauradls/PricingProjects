# PricingProjects

This repository contains two pricing projects that were self-initiated on topics that I'm passinate about. They both came with challenges, but I greatly enjoyed solving complex problems to get to these answers... And using math to do it!

### **1) Price Elasticity**

**Summary**: As an economics and finance major, I decided to compare the behavior of two complementary goods and analyze the monetary effect one has over the other. This type of investigation is very useful for the financial well-being of an enterprise. Two goods are called complementary goods when a larger consumption of one also incentivizes a larger consumption of the other. Through calculus, I have enough tools to determine possible future values of some products, and relying on the Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) concept, advise companies on the price they should set for their products. 

**Data Source:** I designed a survey and promoted it on campus to gather people's willingness to pay. Additionally, I researched and analyzed historical pricing data on these goods. 


### **2) Odd Ratios of Price Expectations**




**Summary**:  and analyzed results data to recommend improvements to printing services
• Using SAS, calculated odds ratios of students’ and faculty’s price expectation on poster printing

**Data Source:** After my "Design of Experiments" class, I followed ethical and statistical principles to design surveys and interview questionnaries that would not compromise the data. This helps avoid the bias of the designer to be inserted into the results.
